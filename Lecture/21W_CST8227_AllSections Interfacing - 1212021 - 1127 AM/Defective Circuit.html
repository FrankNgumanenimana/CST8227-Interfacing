<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In a previous run of the course (W'20), I presented a series of demos featuring a discrete LED controlled by a push-button switch (PBS) that is configured in one of two ways: pull-down or pull-up. In preparation for demo'ing a pull-up configuration, I moved a jumper wire on the Vcc rail to a terminal on the PBS (or so I thought). The demo went side-ways very quickly (!), and I did not observe the expected behaviour of a pull-up configuration.</p>
<p>Here are my notes on what happened.</p>
<h2>The Symptoms</h2>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">expected</span> behaviour of a PBS in pull-up configuration is described as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>when the PBS is open (i.e. not pressed), the discrete LED is on; the value of the PBS is HIGH</li>
<li>when the PBS is closed (i.e. pressed), the discrete LED is off; the value of the PBS is LOW</li>
</ul>
<p>When I pressed my PBS, I did not observe this expected behaviour. Rather, I noticed something different: pressing the PBS caused the Serial.Monitor window to "freeze".</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot showing the "frozen" Serial.Monitor dialog window:</p>

<p>From the screenshot, notice the connection between my BYOD device (my MacBookPro) and the Teensy is lost.</p>
<p>During Tuesday's lecture, the Arduino IDE became a run-away process when the Java AWT threw a run-time exception. The reason: Java ran out of heap space. That's when my MacBook Pro's fan turned on in response to an over-heated CPU. At that point, I had to 'force quit' the Arduino IDE process. Note: I wasn't able to re-create the Arduino IDE as a mis-behaved process, so no screenshots --- sorry!</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>Since I hadn't changed the software (i.e. no changes to the sketch), the issue had to be related to the change I made to the circuit.</p>
<p>This is what I saw:</p>

<p>Notice... the PBS is not protected by the 10k Ohm resistor. The purpose of the resistor is to restrict the amount of current flowing thru the PBS.</p>
<p>When I pressed the PBS, and closed the circuit, too much current flows thru the PBS. The excess current sinks to the Teensy, causing it to drop the USB connection.</p>
<p>As I write this at home, the USB connection does come back after a few seconds. During Tuesday's lecture, I had to 'force quit' the Arduino IDE.</p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>Human error is the reason for the failed demo. I didn't inspect my work after moving the red jumper wire.</p>
